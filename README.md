🧬 SNPFit
A personal side project exploring precision health through gene and health data.

💡 Project Vision
I want to build a simple web app that lets users upload their SNP gene data and basic health checkup results. The system will then use open databases to give science-based lifestyle suggestions – like diet, exercise, or supplements – based on the user’s genetic profile.

This project combines my background in ICT and biotechnology. I'm hoping to build a working demo during this semester to explore how personal data could support better, more tailored health management.

🛠️ Tech Stack (planned)
Frontend: React (or Next.js)

Backend: Node.js / Python / .NET (still deciding)

Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL

Data Sources: dbSNP, GWAS Catalog, SNPedia, ClinVar

Deployment: Docker + Local testing (maybe small cloud deployment later)

🗂️ Planned Features (MVP)
 Upload SNP file (.txt / .vcf)

 Upload/check basic health data

 SNP parser: extract rsID + genotype

 Match against known traits from public databases

 Generate basic lifestyle suggestion report

 Simple dashboard UI

 (Optional) PDF report export

📆 Timeline Goal
This semester:
✔ Define scope
✔ Draw workflow
⬜ Build basic prototype
⬜ Deliver demo or interactive report
