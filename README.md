# 🧬 SNPFit

_A personal side project exploring precision health through gene and health data._

---

## 💡 Project Vision

I want to build a simple web app that lets users upload their SNP gene data and basic health checkup results.  
The system will then use open databases to give science-based lifestyle suggestions – like **diet**, **exercise**, or **supplements** – based on the user’s genetic profile.

This project combines my background in **ICT** and **biotechnology**.  
I'm hoping to build a working demo during this semester to explore how personal data could support better, more tailored health management.
